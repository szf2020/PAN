# PAN — Personal AI Network

PAN is a persistent AI operating system across all devices, projects, and conversations.

> **Feature specs live in [docs/FEATURES.md](./docs/FEATURES.md).** Every button, widget, and
> endpoint is documented there with what it calls, what it preserves, what it
> replaces, and its pre-gate. If you're about to guess what a UI element does —
> check docs/FEATURES.md first. Update it in the same commit as any code change.

> **Transcript/terminal system: read [docs/TRANSCRIPT_SYSTEM.md](./docs/TRANSCRIPT_SYSTEM.md) FIRST**
> before touching anything in `terminal/+page.svelte` related to messages, chat bubbles,
> or rendering. The Svelte proxy vs raw object distinction is the #1 source of bugs here.

> **Nightmare bugs: read [docs/NIGHTMARE_BUGS.md](./docs/NIGHTMARE_BUGS.md) before fixing any recurring bug.**
> These 8 bugs (#444, #439, #438, #431, #430, #435, #432, #376) keep coming back because of
> architectural root causes — not one-off mistakes. Do NOT mark them done without a regression test.

### Key components
- **Phone**: Google STT, Gemini Nano classification (fallback to server), local commands, TTS with echo prevention
- **Server**: Three-tier process hierarchy — Super-Carrier (7777, permanent) → Carrier (17760, restartable) → Craft (17700, hot-swappable). Unified router, SQLite/SQLCipher DB, project sync via .pan files, MCP server
- **Desktop**: Tauri shell, AHK hotkeys, live PTY terminals, persistent tabs
- **AI tiers**: Qwen (phone) → Cerebras 120B (fast) → Claude (smart), shared state
- **Client devices**: pan-client.js installed on other PCs, registers via WS, receives commands. See `docs/MULTI-DEVICE-ROUTING.md`
- **Presence**: Webcam watcher (face ID, 30s) + Screen watcher (vision AI, 60s) → intuition.js context

### Current Projects (auto-detected from .pan files)
- **PAN** — this project
- **WoE Game Design** — War of Eternity (Godot 4.5 RTS)
- **Claude-Discord-Bot** — Discord bot bridging chat to Claude CLI + SSH

## Verification Commands
<constraints>
- Before committing: `node service/src/server.js` must start without crash (ctrl-c after "listening on 7777")
- Python STT: `python service/bin/dictate-vad.py --help` must show usage without import errors
- Android: `JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ./gradlew.bat assembleDebug` in android/
- Dashboard: open http://localhost:7777 and verify no console errors
</constraints>

## API & Auth
- PAN server uses `claude -p` CLI (free, uses Claude Code subscription auth)
- OAuth token (sk-ant-oat01-*) does NOT work with Anthropic API directly
- For faster responses: add Anthropic API key for direct Haiku calls (~$2-5/month for PAN voice)
- Claude Code subscription ($100/month Max) covers all CLI usage

## Key Principle
PAN never forgets. Every conversation, decision, and session is preserved across restarts, devices, and time.

## User
Work autonomously — don't ask for permission, just do it.

## Session Continuity Rule
When a **fresh terminal session starts** (the very first message after `claude` launches), begin with a brief "ΠΑΝ Remembers:" summary of recent topics from the "Recent Conversation" section below. This is ONLY for the first message of a fresh session — NEVER repeat it mid-conversation, NEVER repeat it on follow-up messages, and NEVER re-emit it after a PTY restart or context reload. If you've already said it once in this conversation, do not say it again.

**Anti-repetition rule:** Before writing ANY response, check if you've already said the same thing earlier in this conversation. If you have, do NOT repeat it. Never write the same summary, finding, or explanation twice.

## Dev & Testing

### Environments
| Env | Port | Database | What runs |
|-----|------|----------|-----------|
| **Prod** | 7777 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PAN/data/` | Everything: terminal, steward, orphan reaper, device heartbeat, all services |
| **Dev** | 7781 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PAN/data-dev/` | Full copy of prod (terminal, dashboard, API, sensors, project sync). Skips only system-wide singletons: steward, orphan reaper, device heartbeat |

Dev is an exact copy of prod on a different port + DB. Same terminal, same dashboard page (`/v2/terminal`), same PTY. The page auto-detects dev via port number and uses separate session IDs (`dev-dash-*`).

### Dev Server Commands
```bash
# Start dev (from prod — opens in Electron window)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/dev/start -X POST

# Restart dev (kills old, starts fresh, opens window)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/dev/restart -X POST

# Check dev health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7781/health

# Open dev dashboard directly
# http://localhost:7781/v2/terminal
```

The Instances panel in the dashboard sidebar has **Open** and **Restart** buttons for dev.

### Dashboard (SvelteKit)
- **Source**: `service/dashboard/src/routes/` (Svelte 5 + SvelteKit)
- **Build**: `cd service/dashboard && npm run build` → outputs to `service/public/v2/`
- **MUST rebuild after editing .svelte files** — prod/dev both serve from `public/v2/`
- Key pages: `terminal/+page.svelte` (main), `settings/+page.svelte`, `conversations/+page.svelte`

### Desktop Dashboard Behavior
- **Model switching**: The model selector dropdown saves the chosen model as the default for **new sessions**. To apply a model change, click the **+ button** to create a new tab. Model changes do **not** affect the current running session mid-conversation (the `claude -p` process is already running with a fixed model).
- **New tabs**: Each tab is a separate PTY session running `claude -p --project <dir> --model <model>`. Closing a tab kills the underlying Claude process.

### Process Spawning on Windows
**CRITICAL**: Every `execSync()`, `exec()`, `execFile()`, `spawn()` call MUST include `windowsHide: true` in options. Without it, a visible black CMD window flashes on screen. PAN runs dozens of these per minute (health checks, process enumeration, taskkill) — missing `windowsHide` causes hundreds of CMD windows opening/closing.

### Tests
- Tests run via the dashboard Tests panel (right sidebar)
- ALL verification is visual via screenshots — never curl/API
- Test suites have dependency chains — if a dependency fails, dependents are skipped
- Platform Compatibility test validates `service/src/platform.js` cross-platform abstractions

### Phone Dashboard Architecture
The phone opens the dashboard via **Android WebView** (not a browser — no address bar).
- **WebView source**: `android/app/src/main/java/dev/pan/app/ui/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt`
- **Loads**: `http://127.0.0.1:<proxyPort>/mobile/?t=<timestamp>` via local Tailscale proxy
- **Cache**: WebView nukes all cache on every load (`LOAD_NO_CACHE` + `clearCache(true)` + timestamp bust)
- **Console logs**: `WebChromeClient` captures JS `console.log` → Android logcat as `PAN-DASH JS:`
- **Static HTML**: `service/public/mobile/index.html` — no build step, changes are live immediately
- **Auth**: Requests go through Tailscale proxy → arrive at server as Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) → auto-authenticated
- **Sending messages**: Uses `/api/v1/terminal/pipe` (pipe mode) with session ID resolved from `/api/v1/terminal/sessions`
- **Receiving messages**: Polls `/api/v1/terminal/messages/<session_id>` every 3 seconds, fingerprint-based re-render
- **NOT the desktop dashboard**: Desktop uses SvelteKit (`/v2/terminal`), phone uses static HTML (`/mobile/`)

### Phone Voice Pipeline
Phone mic → Google STT (on-device) → text → server `/api/v1/terminal/send` or router
- **AI routing**: `service/src/claude.js` `getModelForCaller(caller)` checks `job_models` setting, falls back to `ai_model` setting
- **Current config**: `ai_model = cerebras:qwen-3-235b` → all router calls go to Cerebras (free, ~580ms)
- **Backend selection**: `getBackend()` in `claude.js` checks model prefix: `cerebras:` → Cerebras, Anthropic models → SDK or API key, other → custom
- **Usage tracking**: `ai_usage` table logs every call with caller, model, tokens, cost. Query via `/api/automation/usage`
- **Phone logs**: `LogShipper.kt` batches every 5s → `POST /api/v1/logs`. Pull with `curl /api/v1/logs?device_type=phone`
- **Browser telemetry**: Ship from mobile page JS via `fetch('/api/v1/logs', { body: { device_id: 'phone-dashboard', ... } })`

### Super-Carrier / Carrier / Craft Architecture
Three-tier hierarchy. See `docs/SUPER-CARRIER.md` for full details.
- **Super-Carrier** (permanent): owns port **7777**, buffers WS frames during restarts, never dies
- **Carrier** (restartable): owns port **17760**, WebSocket, PTY sessions, reconnect tokens. Restart via `POST /api/carrier/restart`
- **Craft** (hot-swappable): `server.js` on port **17700+**. Swap via `POST /api/carrier/swap` (Lifeboat widget)
- **Port cleanup**: Carrier kills stale processes on port 17700 before spawning new Craft (prevents crash loops)
- **PAN.bat**: Launches `pan-loop.bat` → spawns `node super-carrier.js`. Loop restarts on crash (exit ≠ 0), stops on clean exit
- **Sleep/wake**: After system sleep, old Craft may hold port 17700. Carrier cleanup + PAN.bat exit-on-healthy prevents loops

## PAN Session Context

This is a fresh session for the "PAN" project.
IMPORTANT: The project documentation is at the TOP of this CLAUDE.md file — read it first.

**Session context** (for the first message of a fresh session only — see Session Continuity Rule above):

### This Tab *(session: a938bbf4-26e)*
**User** (2026-05-11 17:56:49): I'm pretty sure we already have this top of the page banner on the phone I already see that we don't have response time showing don't have conversational umm Dr Faso follow up to proactive level intuition which project Yeah we don't have any of that 
**Claude** (2026-05-11 18:02:15): Done. Single file, four areas changed, no server changes (so no carrier restart needed) — phone WebView cache-busts on every load, so **pull-to-refresh on the phone picks it up immediately**.

## What you'll see on the phone after a refresh

| Where 
**User** (2026-05-11 18:05:38): Well doesn't this need a phone ADB update because this is not this is not in the dashboard of the phone this is literally in the phone's application So you said update the phone but did you actually B rebuild the application 'cause I think you have t
**Claude** (2026-05-11 18:17:03): Shipped to the **native phone app** this time (Pixel 10 Pro, install confirmed, app relaunched).

## What's new on the main screen

A new **PAN Thinking card** sits right below the IntuitionCard. It mirrors that card's style but shows what *PAN* is d
**User** (2026-05-12 04:48:49): OK so I've been testing it it's pretty fast I see I see actually what the intuition of payers actually doing It interrupts itself When I asked it a complex question it interrupted itself it isn't complete you know what it's trying to say I guess it's
**Claude** (2026-05-12 04:52:27): Found smoking guns in the phone logs. Quick summary before I dive in:

## 1. Self-interruption — confirmed false barge-in
Log line **#4700** is the smoking gun:
```
[BargeIn] Baseline=0 threshold=120
User interrupted TTS         ← fires while PAN is 
**User** (2026-05-12 09:19:28): OK yeah go ahead and do that Just do all three all three of them are important

### Recent Project Work *(session: dcfa7b43-c79)*
**Claude** (2026-05-10 08:49:40): Guardian is running and PAN is back up on port 7777. The Windows shortcut should now work — try it.
**User** (2026-05-12 17:25:57): Can you reach my pro desk too I can reach pro desk but I can't reach pro desk 2VIA Rust Desk
**Claude** (2026-05-12 17:26:11): I can't directly control RustDesk, but I can check if PAN/Tailscale can reach Pro Desk 2 to narrow down whether it's a network issue or RustDesk-specific. What's the Tailscale IP or hostname of Pro Desk 2?
**User** (2026-05-12 17:27:53): Yeah obviously I want you to do that and or maybe SSH in there
**Claude** (2026-05-12 17:31:04): Every remote access port is closed on Pro Desk 2 — SSH, RDP, WinRM all blocked or not running. The machine IS alive (Tailscale confirms it), but there's no way in remotely right now.

The most likely cause: RustDesk crashed or stopped on Pro Desk 2, 
**User** (2026-05-12 17:31:35): That's not true because we set up SSH on all these computers
**Claude** (2026-05-12 17:35:35): MiniPC isn't on the same LAN, so can't use it as a hop.

Since you CAN briefly get into Pro Desk 2 via RustDesk before it drops — the next time you get in, the fastest fix is to quickly open a Run dialog (`Win+R`) and paste this to enable SSH:

```
p
**User** (2026-05-12 17:37:03): What was the last topic discussed in this session?
**Claude** (2026-05-12 17:37:10): The last topic was troubleshooting remote access to **Pro Desk 2** (`tedprodesk2`, `100.86.16.10`). Summary of what was found:

- Tailscale reaches it at 268ms via DERP relay (Miami) — no direct connection
- SSH port 22 times out (service likely stop
**User** (2026-05-12 17:37:53): Summarize the last thing we were working on in one paragraph

### Open Tasks
- [#466 backlog] Voice trace ID: end-to-end correlation across phone log + server router + AI usage + TTS
- [#470 in_test] steward: ollama restart action is a no-op (startFn disabled) but logs
