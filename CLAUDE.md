# PAN — Personal AI Network

PAN is a persistent AI operating system across all devices, projects, and conversations.

> **Architecture lives in [docs/PAN-ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/PAN-ARCHITECTURE.md).**
> PAN is 8 functional sections — **Intuition is the cortex (~50% of the system)**;
> Memory, Capabilities, Jobs, Devices, Comms, Learning, and Security wrap around it.
> Read that doc before reorganizing code or asking "where does this belong?".
> The Mermaid diagram below shows *deployment topology* (Phone/Server/Desktop/Pendant) —
> the architecture doc shows the *functional sections* (what each part IS).

> **Feature specs live in [docs/FEATURES.md](./docs/FEATURES.md).** Every button, widget, and
> endpoint is documented there with what it calls, what it preserves, what it
> replaces, and its pre-gate. If you're about to guess what a UI element does —
> check docs/FEATURES.md first. Update it in the same commit as any code change.

> **Transcript/terminal system: read [docs/TRANSCRIPT_SYSTEM.md](./docs/TRANSCRIPT_SYSTEM.md) FIRST**
> before touching anything in `terminal/+page.svelte` related to messages, chat bubbles,
> or rendering. The Svelte proxy vs raw object distinction is the #1 source of bugs here.

> **Nightmare bugs: read [docs/NIGHTMARE_BUGS.md](./docs/NIGHTMARE_BUGS.md) before fixing any recurring bug.**
> These 8 bugs (#444, #439, #438, #431, #430, #435, #432, #376) keep coming back because of
> architectural root causes — not one-off mistakes. Do NOT mark them done without a regression test.

### Key components
- **Phone**: Google STT, Gemini Nano classification (fallback to server), local commands, TTS with echo prevention
- **Server**: Three-tier process hierarchy — Super-Carrier (7777, permanent) → Carrier (17760, restartable) → Craft (17700, hot-swappable). Unified router, SQLite/SQLCipher DB, project sync via .pan files, MCP server
- **Desktop**: Tauri shell, AHK hotkeys, live PTY terminals, persistent tabs
- **AI tiers**: Qwen (phone) → Cerebras 120B (fast) → Claude (smart), shared state
- **Client devices**: pan-client.js installed on other PCs, registers via WS, receives commands. See `docs/MULTI-DEVICE-ROUTING.md`
- **Presence**: Webcam watcher (face ID, 30s) + Screen watcher (vision AI, 60s) → intuition.js context

### Current Projects (auto-detected from .pan files)
- **PAN** — this project
- **WoE Game Design** — War of Eternity (Godot 4.5 RTS)
- **Claude-Discord-Bot** — Discord bot bridging chat to Claude CLI + SSH

## Verification Commands
<constraints>
- Before committing: `node service/src/server.js` must start without crash (ctrl-c after "listening on 7777")
- Python STT: `python service/bin/dictate-vad.py --help` must show usage without import errors
- Android: `JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr" ./gradlew.bat assembleDebug` in android/
- Dashboard: open http://localhost:7777 and verify no console errors
</constraints>

## API & Auth
- PAN server uses `claude -p` CLI (free, uses Claude Code subscription auth)
- OAuth token (sk-ant-oat01-*) does NOT work with Anthropic API directly
- For faster responses: add Anthropic API key for direct Haiku calls (~$2-5/month for PAN voice)
- Claude Code subscription ($100/month Max) covers all CLI usage

## Key Principle
PAN never forgets. Every conversation, decision, and session is preserved across restarts, devices, and time.

## User
Work autonomously — don't ask for permission, just do it.

## Session Continuity Rule
When a **fresh terminal session starts** (the very first message after `claude` launches), begin with a brief "ΠΑΝ Remembers:" summary of recent topics from the "Recent Conversation" section below. This is ONLY for the first message of a fresh session — NEVER repeat it mid-conversation, NEVER repeat it on follow-up messages, and NEVER re-emit it after a PTY restart or context reload. If you've already said it once in this conversation, do not say it again.

**Anti-repetition rule:** Before writing ANY response, check if you've already said the same thing earlier in this conversation. If you have, do NOT repeat it. Never write the same summary, finding, or explanation twice.

## Dev & Testing

### Environments
| Env | Port | Database | What runs |
|-----|------|----------|-----------|
| **Prod** | 7777 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PAN/data/` | Everything: terminal, steward, orphan reaper, device heartbeat, all services |
| **Dev** | 7781 | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PAN/data-dev/` | Full copy of prod (terminal, dashboard, API, sensors, project sync). Skips only system-wide singletons: steward, orphan reaper, device heartbeat |

Dev is an exact copy of prod on a different port + DB. Same terminal, same dashboard page (`/v2/terminal`), same PTY. The page auto-detects dev via port number and uses separate session IDs (`dev-dash-*`).

### Dev Server Commands
```bash
# Start dev (from prod — opens in Electron window)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/dev/start -X POST

# Restart dev (kills old, starts fresh, opens window)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/dev/restart -X POST

# Check dev health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7781/health

# Open dev dashboard directly
# http://localhost:7781/v2/terminal
```

The Instances panel in the dashboard sidebar has **Open** and **Restart** buttons for dev.

### Dashboard (SvelteKit)
- **Source**: `service/dashboard/src/routes/` (Svelte 5 + SvelteKit)
- **Build**: `cd service/dashboard && npm run build` → outputs to `service/public/v2/`
- **MUST rebuild after editing .svelte files** — prod/dev both serve from `public/v2/`
- Key pages: `terminal/+page.svelte` (main), `settings/+page.svelte`, `conversations/+page.svelte`

### Desktop Dashboard Behavior
- **Model switching**: The model selector dropdown saves the chosen model as the default for **new sessions**. To apply a model change, click the **+ button** to create a new tab. Model changes do **not** affect the current running session mid-conversation (the `claude -p` process is already running with a fixed model).
- **New tabs**: Each tab is a separate PTY session running `claude -p --project <dir> --model <model>`. Closing a tab kills the underlying Claude process.

### Process Spawning on Windows
**CRITICAL**: Every `execSync()`, `exec()`, `execFile()`, `spawn()` call MUST include `windowsHide: true` in options. Without it, a visible black CMD window flashes on screen. PAN runs dozens of these per minute (health checks, process enumeration, taskkill) — missing `windowsHide` causes hundreds of CMD windows opening/closing.

### Tests
- Tests run via the dashboard Tests panel (right sidebar)
- ALL verification is visual via screenshots — never curl/API
- Test suites have dependency chains — if a dependency fails, dependents are skipped
- Platform Compatibility test validates `service/src/platform.js` cross-platform abstractions

### Phone Dashboard Architecture
The phone opens the dashboard via **Android WebView** (not a browser — no address bar).
- **WebView source**: `android/app/src/main/java/dev/pan/app/ui/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt`
- **Loads**: `http://127.0.0.1:<proxyPort>/mobile/?t=<timestamp>` via local Tailscale proxy
- **Cache**: WebView nukes all cache on every load (`LOAD_NO_CACHE` + `clearCache(true)` + timestamp bust)
- **Console logs**: `WebChromeClient` captures JS `console.log` → Android logcat as `PAN-DASH JS:`
- **Static HTML**: `service/public/mobile/index.html` — no build step, changes are live immediately
- **Auth**: Requests go through Tailscale proxy → arrive at server as Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x) → auto-authenticated
- **Sending messages**: Uses `/api/v1/terminal/pipe` (pipe mode) with session ID resolved from `/api/v1/terminal/sessions`
- **Receiving messages**: Polls `/api/v1/terminal/messages/<session_id>` every 3 seconds, fingerprint-based re-render
- **NOT the desktop dashboard**: Desktop uses SvelteKit (`/v2/terminal`), phone uses static HTML (`/mobile/`)

### Phone Voice Pipeline
Phone mic → Google STT (on-device) → text → server `/api/v1/terminal/send` or router
- **AI routing**: `service/src/claude.js` `getModelForCaller(caller)` checks `job_models` setting, falls back to `ai_model` setting
- **Current config**: `ai_model = cerebras:qwen-3-235b` → all router calls go to Cerebras (free, ~580ms)
- **Backend selection**: `getBackend()` in `claude.js` checks model prefix: `cerebras:` → Cerebras, Anthropic models → SDK or API key, other → custom
- **Usage tracking**: `ai_usage` table logs every call with caller, model, tokens, cost. Query via `/api/automation/usage`
- **Phone logs**: `LogShipper.kt` batches every 5s → `POST /api/v1/logs`. Pull with `curl /api/v1/logs?device_type=phone`
- **Browser telemetry**: Ship from mobile page JS via `fetch('/api/v1/logs', { body: { device_id: 'phone-dashboard', ... } })`

### Super-Carrier / Carrier / Craft Architecture
Three-tier hierarchy. See `docs/SUPER-CARRIER.md` for full details.
- **Super-Carrier** (permanent): owns port **7777**, buffers WS frames during restarts, never dies
- **Carrier** (restartable): owns port **17760**, WebSocket, PTY sessions, reconnect tokens. Restart via `POST /api/carrier/restart`
- **Craft** (hot-swappable): `server.js` on port **17700+**. Swap via `POST /api/carrier/swap` (Lifeboat widget)
- **Port cleanup**: Carrier kills stale processes on port 17700 before spawning new Craft (prevents crash loops)
- **PAN.bat**: Launches `pan-loop.bat` → spawns `node super-carrier.js`. Loop restarts on crash (exit ≠ 0), stops on clean exit
- **Sleep/wake**: After system sleep, old Craft may hold port 17700. Carrier cleanup + PAN.bat exit-on-healthy prevents loops

## PAN Session Context

This is a fresh session for the "PAN" project.
IMPORTANT: The project documentation is at the TOP of this CLAUDE.md file — read it first.

**Session context** (for the first message of a fresh session only — see Session Continuity Rule above):

### This Tab *(session: 33f7601d-32c)*
**Claude** (2026-05-16 10:36:51): ΠΑΝ Remembers: post-sleep Craft health lock (#500 filed, fix shipped), caveman-compress Windows fixes (#501 done), Carrier stabilized after the async handler fix, and you asked about locating the Star Sector download + OneDrive reinstalling itself.
**User** (2026-05-16 10:37:24): OK so no we are working on another system before show me all the tasks and what we are working on today We were working on a system that had to do with the steward and auto corrections with the forge and the scout and all that stuff so that their wid
**Claude** (2026-05-16 10:37:53): Here's the widget self-healing stack — that's the cluster you spun up yesterday/today (#503–#508), built on top of the existing Forge/Scout loop (#459):

**Dashboard Auto-Recovery Chain**
- **#503** `in_progress p1` — Dashboard auto-recovery: black-s
**User** (2026-05-16 10:41:39): OK where did we get to I mean we should finish right but we're not actually done until we make all of these steps And then of course once we do all of these we have to test it
**Claude** (2026-05-16 10:42:39): OK here's the real state — substrate is mostly there, but coverage and wiring are incomplete, and **the telemetry itself proves the system is working but not closing the loop yet**:

## Layer-by-layer status

| # | Layer | Built? | Gap |
|---|---|---
**User** (2026-05-16 11:05:32): Yeah go ahead and do that
**Claude** (2026-05-16 11:07:56): **Status: most of the system works. There's one real bug and one coverage gap.**

| Layer | Wired? | Firing? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 substrate | partial | n/a | 16 `data-widget` attrs — dozens of panels still untagged |
| L2 telemetry | ✓

### Recent Project Work *(session: 9f1e7e0b-39e)*
**User** (2026-05-16 10:56:20): You
**Claude** (2026-05-16 10:57:39): Found them! You have Star Sector in **three locations**:

1. **C:\Users\tzuri\Downloads** — Installer
   - `starsector_install-0.98a-RC8.exe` (280 MB, downloaded today at 10:02 AM)

2. **C:\Users\tzuri\StarSector\StarsectorOld** — Old installation
  

### Open Tasks
- [#466 backlog] Voice trace ID: end-to-end correlation across phone log + server router + AI usage + TTS
- [#470 in_test] steward: ollama restart action is a no-op (startFn disabled) but logs success — clean up the lie
- [#458 backlog] Tab list rebuild fragile across Craft swap — pan-4 tab disappeared after swap
- [#459 backlog] Forge: Opus auto-fix loop on Scout-detected bugs
- [#462 in_test] router.js: emit empty chunk for [AMBIENT] verdicts so phone sees a fast 'no-op' response
- [#464 in_test] steward: ollama health check 3s ping produces false-negatives under load — phantom DOWN→RUNNING bounces every ~2min
- [#465 in_test] AI usage tracking: tag every router call with source (phone-id / dashboard / scout / etc.) — 'router' bucket too coarse
- [#468 backlog] Phone: health-aware degradation banner — show 'PAN running on backup' when ollama/embeddings/whisper degraded
- [#469 backlog] Voice timeline panel in Kronos — per-prompt route, latency, response
- [#484 backlog] Terminal: markdown table columns word-wrap on path separators � short cells should stay one line
